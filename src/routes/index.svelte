<h1 class="text-center text-4xl mb-5">Resourcing Open Source Software</h1>
<article class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
  <p class="mb-3">
    Open source software projects have become akin to public utilities, utilized by more than 90% of
    software applications<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. But these projects are often fragile,
    passing along security vulnerabilities, suffering “bit rot,” and abandonment by maintainers.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    We believe that the root cause is a lack of project <i>sustainability</i>&mdash;stakeholders
    lack the necessary resources (time, money, and skill) to adequately steward the project for the
    long-term.

    rather the production process itself. That leads to a tangible goal:

    Pioneer new economic systems that maximize the impact of developer hours in the production of
    open source software.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-3">
    At a high level, we are interested in solutions that explore one of four strategies:

  <ol class="list-decimal mb-5">
    <li class="ml-8">
      <p>Increase the total number of available hours.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="ml-8">
      <p>Increase the efficiency of existing hours.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="ml-8">
      <p>Eliminate wasteful hours.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="ml-8">
      <p>Redirect hours to higher priority tasks and projects.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="text-2xl mt-5 mb-3">A Think and Do Lab</h2>
  <p class="mb-3">
    The SocioTechnica approach is to think <i>and</i> do. The process has three broad phases:
    <span class="italic font-semibold text-neutral-700">exploration</span>,
    <span class="italic font-semibold text-neutral-700">theory-building</span>, and
    <span class="italic font-semibold text-neutral-700">experimentation</span>, which proceed in an
    iterative manner. We build towards live economic systems informed by real-world tests. The lab
    is designed to produce working systems, not merely to capture and disseminate knowledge.

    startups and consulting, playing most of the positions one can play in tech from developer to CTO.
    I believe that computation represents a fundamental shift in human capacity, similar in scope to
    the creation of spoken language or writing. There are innumerable opportunities to improve upon the
    primitive, yet amazing machines that we spend hours with every day!
