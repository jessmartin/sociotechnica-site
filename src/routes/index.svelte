<article class="leading-relaxed text-lg">
	<p class="text-xl mb-3">
		We believe that software creation and maintenance is a poorly architected system that drives
		chronic project under-resourcing, which leads to a range of problems:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-disc mb-3">
		<li class="ml-8">
			<p>general instability in a piece of humanity's core infrastructure</p>
		</li>
		<li class="ml-8">
			<p>wasting tens of thousands of developer hours per year</p>
		</li>
		<li class="ml-8">
			<p>creating unnecessary barriers to entry for new software developers</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="text-2xl mt-5 mb-3">Proposed Solution</h2>
	<p class="mb-3">
		We believe that the solution lies in a think-and-do lab that pioneers new economic systems, with
		novel processes and incentives. Our plan:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-decimal mb-5">
		<li class="ml-8">
			<p>
				Run funding experiments following best practices to understand operational realities and
				constraints.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="ml-8">
			<p>
				Create an industry segmentation map of engaged and prospective maintainers, funders and
				developers.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="ml-8">
			<p>Explore adjacent and unrelated industries to find great ideas.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="ml-8">
			<p>
				Publish our findings, including analysis of the present, ideas for a more sustainable
				future, and hypotheses for how to get there.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="ml-8">
			<p>
				Create a prioritized queue of experiments and begin testing our way to a brighter future.
